## Introduction
Bio-Signals, In this project we are considering Speech Evoked Potentials (SpEPs), these are signals produced by the brainâ€™s auditory stem when it is subjected to audio signals (specifically speech).
Throughout the years lot of research has been performed to determine the relation between sound and brain stem response (brain waves) and how they correlate with each other [2]. 
By the research, it is proven that, there is are similarities in patterns of SpEPs signals when humans are subjected to here the audio signals (Example: Vowels). The significant problem comes with how to classify the SpEPs efficiently as they are minute, distorted in many ways.
Considering the problem, with the help of complex machine learning algorithms like Neural Network and Support Vector Machine (SVM), we developing a model using python programming language that can efficiently classify the SpEP signals based on particular VOWEL (a/e/ae/o/u) with significantly low error rate
The end goal of classifying SpEPs can help the early diagnosis of speech or
hearing impairment in the infants to seek possible cause and treatment as early as possible.
